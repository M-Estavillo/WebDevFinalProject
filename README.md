# 💰Expense Tracker💰

### **📋 Overview**

Managing personal finances is an important yet overlooked part of daily life. Many people struggle to keep track of where their money goes, and usually have to rely on mental notes🧠, receipts🧾, short memos✍️, or messy spreadsheets📉. Expense Tracker was developed to solve this issue by providing an efficient and user-friendly solution that can help its users record and analyze their spending habits in one place. The application allows users to log expenses together with descriptions such as name, amount, category, and date, and displays the data in both list📃 and chart📊 formats for quick analysis.

Built with a Node.js and Express.js backend🛠️, and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend🎨, the app doesn't compromise between both functionality and simplicity. Users can add➕, edit✏️, delete❌, and filter🔍 expenses, while a real-time pie chart provides a clear visual breakdown of where money is spent. Data is stored securely using a MySQL database. Whether for personal use or as a foundation for a larger financial app, Expense Tracker can be an easy and practical solution for monitoring your budget🧾💸.

### **🌟 Features**
