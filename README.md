Expense Tracker

Overview

Managing personal finances is an important yet overlooked part of daily life. Many people struggle to keep track of where their money goes, and usually have to rely on mental notes, receipts, short memos, or messy spreadsheets. Expense Tracker was developed to solve this issue by providing an efficient and user-friendly solution that can help its users record and analyze their spending habits in one place. The application allows users to log expenses together with descriptions such as name, amount, category, and date, and displays the data in both list and chart formats for quick analysis.

Built with a Node.js and Express.js backend, and an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, the app doesn't compromise between both functionality and simplicity. Users can add, edit, delete, and filter expenses, while a real-time pie chart provides a clear visual breakdown of where money is spent. Data is stored securely using a MySQL database. Whether for personal use or as a foundation for a larger financial app, Expense Tracker can be an easy and practical solution for monitoring your budget.

Features
- Users can input new expense entries by providing details such as the item name, amount, category, and date.
- These entries can be edited or removed as needed.
- A filtering feature also allows users to sort expenses by category, enabling them to analyze spending patterns more easily.
- The application also displays the total amount spent, which updates automatically as changes are made.
- A pie chart provides a visual representation of the expenses categorized by type, making it easier to interpret spending habits.

In terms of data storage, the system uses a MySQL database to ensure data persistence and reliability.

Tech Stack

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and responsive interface. Data visualization is powered by Chart.js, allowing for dynamic and visually appealing representations of financial data. On the backend, Node.js and Express.js are used to handle the server logic and API endpoints. MySQL serves as the application's primary database, managed through the mysql2 npm package for smooth and secure data transactions.
